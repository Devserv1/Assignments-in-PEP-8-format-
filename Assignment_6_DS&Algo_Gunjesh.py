# The time complexity of the provided code is  O(n * log2(n)).
# 
# The outer loop iterates from n // 2 to n, which is roughly half the size of n. So, it runs approximately n // 2 times.
# 
# The inner loop starts at 2 and doubles j in each iteration until j reaches or exceeds n. This effectively makes the inner loop run approximately log2(n) times.
# 
# Inside the inner loop, there are constant-time operations such as addition and division.
# 
# In summary, the time complexity of the code can be approximated as O((n // 2) * log2(n)), which simplifies to O(n * log2(n)) in big O notation.

# The time complexity of the provided code is O(n^2).
# 
# The provided code has nested loops. The outer loop iterates 'n' times, and for each iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop runs an average of 'n/2' times. Inside the inner loop, there are constant-time operations.
# 
# As a result, the overall time complexity of the code is O(n * (n/2)), which simplifies to O(n^2) in big O notation.
